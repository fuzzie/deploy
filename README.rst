This directory contains tools to help deploy a SL toolchain on a Unix
box.

There are two components here:

- in the subdirectory ``installer/``, the SL tool chain installer
  itself. See CSA note [sl12] for more details.

- in the subdirectory ``dist/``, a set of rules to create
  the distributable archives that can be uploaded to the public repository.

2011-03-07  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Protect the installation process against stray envvars.

	* deploy/dist/mgsim-dist.mk: Remove check on configure output.

2011-03-06  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Do not require `libgnugetopt' on OS X any more.

	The latest combination of M4 / OS X does not seem to require this.

	* deploy/installer/configure.ac: Remove the tests on
	`libgnugetopt'.
	
2011-03-06  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

2010-12-15  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Upgrade installer to 3.2.

	* deploy/installer/build-aux/package_version: Do it.

2010-12-14  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Refactor the installer as a result of the gcc/binutils cleanup.

	* deploy/installer/bootstrap: Use `sl-init-autoconf' to fetch the
	build auxiliary files.

	* deploy/installer/rules/mggcc.mk: Remove.

	* deploy/installer/rules/binutils.mk: Do not build the base
	targets any more, since the compiler now uses the `mt' targets
	always.

	* deploy/installer/rules/gcc.mk: Build the `mt' target now.

2010-12-14  Raphael 'kena' Poss  <r.c.poss@uva.nl>

	Refactor the deployment utilities as a result of the gcc/binutils cleanup.

	The custom GCC patch was recently integrated as a 'mtalpha' target
	on a dedicated Microthreaded-enabled GCC tree. This drops the
	requirement for both the ÂµTC core compiler and the
	'alpha-linux-gnu' binutils targets. Additionally, development on
	the custom binutils was also moved to a dedicated repository.
	
	* deploy/dist/common.mk,
	* deploy/dist/dist-common.mk: Forget about `mggcc'.
	
	* deploy/dist/mggcc-dist.mk: Remove.

	* deploy/dist/dist-common.mk,
	* deploy/dist/binutils-dist.mk,
	* deploy/dist/gcc-dist.mk,
	* deploy/dist/slc-dist.mk: Fetch source from Git repositories
	instead of Subversion.

	* deploy/dist/m4-dist.mk: Use the Git hash in the source tree name
	instead of timestamps to support persistence across builds.

	* deploy/patches/gcc.patch: Remove, as this is now integrated
	in a branch on a dedicated GCC repository.

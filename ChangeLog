	Refactor the deployment utilities as a result of the gcc/binutils cleanup.

	The custom GCC patch was recently integrated as a 'mtalpha' target
	on a dedicated Microthreaded-enabled GCC tree. This drops the
	requirement for both the ÂµTC core compiler and the
	'alpha-linux-gnu' binutils targets. Additionally, development on
	the custom binutils was also moved to a dedicated repository.
	
	* deploy/dist/common.mk,
	* deploy/dist/dist-common.mk: Forget about `mggcc'.
	
	* deploy/dist/mggcc-dist.mk: Remove.

	* deploy/dist/dist-common.mk,
	* deploy/dist/binutils-dist.mk,
	* deploy/dist/gcc-dist.mk,
	* deploy/dist/slc-dist.mk: Fetch source from Git repositories
	instead of Subversion.

	* deploy/dist/m4-dist.mk: Use the Git hash in the source tree name
	instead of timestamps to support persistence across builds.

	* deploy/patches/gcc.patch: Remove, as this is now integrated
	in a branch on a dedicated GCC repository.
